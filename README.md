- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @GunnarIsenberg
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in software development, not just from a professional point of view but how it has helped   
  me learn to think critically about problems that I have found in my own life! 

  Iâ€™m currently learning GIT, C#/.NET, and working through some online data structures/algorithm classes - I have
a decent understanding of python for a total beginner & can read HTML and CSS - though I cant align a div....

  If you have any questions feel free to email me at gunnarisenberg@outlook.com! 
  Cant wait to forget about this readme and have it cost me a job in a year!
