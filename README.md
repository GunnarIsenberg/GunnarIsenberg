- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @GunnarIsenberg
- ðŸ‘€ I like code even if it sometimes makes me feel dumb

- I Really like the C# langauge & look forward to learning more about it!
- I am comfortable with python and probably do most of my work in python
- I am learning SQL because I tried to connect a project to a Microsoft Access database
    once and learned thats not something I want to do anymore!
